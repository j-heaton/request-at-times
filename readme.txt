this is a simple script that will accept a csv containing timestamps at midnight, then make requests to a specified URL at each timestamp

to execute this script: 
from the command line type 'python request.py'
the csv should be in the same folder as the script

the script will read the csv at the next midnight, make sure that it is in the same location as the script
the script will stop after it has made a request at each specified time
